# Experiment with ZDog

## Cons
- No click or hover handlers
- No inspect (canvas)
- Rotation is based on TAU (which can be confusing)
- Maybe a memory leak in lib, seems to use a lot of RAM over time, which could be bad for battery life

## Pros
- Simple interface / easy to draw
- Fast
- Assume works well on mobile, since it's all GPU
